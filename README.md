# Form App Code Challenge

## Coding Task Difficulty:
MEDIUM

## Objective:
Create a responsive Form Application in React where users can fill out a job application form with various field types, validation, conditional rendering, and simulated API submission.

## Requirements:

### Form Structure:
- Create a multi-section form with at least 4 distinct sections (e.g., Personal Information, Professional Experience, etc.)
- Implement various form field types (text, email, select, checkbox, radio, textarea, etc.)
- Add proper validation for required fields and specific formats (email, phone, etc.)

### Responsive Design:
- Ensure the form is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices
- Implement a clean, user-friendly layout that adapts to different screen sizes

### State Management:
- Use React state management (useState, useContext, or Redux) to handle form data
- Implement controlled components for all form inputs
- Create a centralized state structure to manage all form values

### Performance Optimization:
- Implement debouncing for input validation to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo or other optimization techniques where appropriate

### Conditional Rendering:
- Add at least one section that only appears based on user selection
- Implement dynamic form fields that change based on user input

### API Submission Simulation:
- Create a mock API submission function with loading states
- Implement success and error handling for form submission
- Display appropriate feedback to the user after submission

## Implementation Details:
- Use React hooks for state management and side effects
- Structure your components in a modular, reusable way
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of form fields and validation
- Effective state management and data handling
- Proper implementation of responsive design
- Successful implementation of conditional rendering
- Clean, readable, and well-organized code
- Proper handling of form submission and user feedback
